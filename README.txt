*SIMPLE SHELL READ ME FILE*

This is a learning project; the whole purpose of this shell is educational; by leaving it like this I hope anyone who is trying to learn how to build their own shell or learn about some simple concepts in it (like signals or parent/child proceses) will benifit from it. 

Almost all of the code and the documentation is gonna be under BSD-2.

I will not be maintaining this once I see it's stable enough for its purpose

If you find anything worth changing(i.e a huge bug that needs to be fixed or people who are trying to learn from this code will be damaged) please let me know.
