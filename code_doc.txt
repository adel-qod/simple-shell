The code is organized as follows:

main.c: contains nothing but the main function which sets some signal handlers and then starts calling the shell functions to parse the user input

signalHandling.c: This file contains the signal handler functions registered by the main.

inputHandling.c: This file contains all the functions related to input handling, including the function that parses the commands and the functions that execute the built in commands 

processHandling.c: This file contains the functions related to maintaining jobs and to run/terminate/resume process/jobs
A job is defined as an executable called by the user along with all its children

sysCallsWrapper.c: A file that contains wrappers for common system calls and the signal function, the reasons why these wrappers exist is in the file itself but generally the idea is to avoid potenial bugs 

stringUtils.c: contains mainly two exported functions, one is count words which and the other is a split function that splits a string in an array.
